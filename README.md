# packlist

## An open-source packing list for Android

Why another packing-list... because existing are incomplete, out-of-date or expensive and anyway not open-source.
Which is very disappointing when you wish to save your lists and keep your phone out of always running tracking apps.

You can download APK on releases page  : https://github.com/nbossard/packlist/releases
or 
[![Get it on F-Droid](get_it_on_f-droid.png?raw=true)](https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdid=com.nbossard.packlist)
or
[![Get it on Play Store](play_store_logo.png?raw=true)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nbossard.packlist)

Tech note : GitHub and Play Store releases use same certificate. F-droid use their own certificate.

 - large usage of plantuml for documentation ([see project plantuml doc](doc/plantuml.md))
 - re-use of external libraries on GitHub
